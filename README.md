2. Problem Statement
In a world full of noisy fans that insist on producing‚Ä¶ actual wind, no one has addressed the serious problem of people who want the soothing sound of a fan without the inconvenience of moving air.
This has led to an epidemic of over-aired faces, flying papers, and cold coffee. Aerovoid solves this urgent crisis.

4. Features
-Multiple Fan Types ‚Äì Each with its own unique sound.
-Speed Control ‚Äì Slow, Medium, High modes.
-On/Off Toggle ‚Äì Just like a real fan, but way more pointless.
